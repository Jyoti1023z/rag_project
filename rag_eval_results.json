    "question": "According to the Supreme Court decision in Haryana Power Purchase Centre (HPPC) vs GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd (2025), how should coal supplied under firm and tapering linkage be apportioned among project beneficiaries?",
    "ground_truth": "Coal supplied under firm and tapering linkage to the power generating company should be apportioned on a pro rata basis to all beneficiaries of the project, and the cost of procurement from alternate sources to meet any shortfall is also to be apportioned proportionally based on power supplied to the beneficiaries.",
    "answer": "Of course! I'd be happy to explain that. Based on the provided documents regarding the case of *Haryana Power Purchase Centre (HPPC) vs Gmr Kamalanga Energy Limited*, here is a detailed explanation of how coal should be apportioned.\n\nThe core principle established in the case, which upholds the findings of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), is that the allocation of coal was made to the GMR Kamalanga Energy Limited (GKEL) project **as a whole** and not for any specific procurer.\n\nTherefore, the apportionment must be done on a **pro-rata basis** among all beneficiaries of the project.\n\nHere are the specific details from the documents:\n\n### **1. Pro-Rata Apportionment for All Coal Types**\n\n*   The ruling explicitly states that both **firm linkage coal** and **tapering linkage coal** supplied to GKEL must be apportioned on a pro-rata basis to all beneficiaries.\n*   The beneficiaries identified in the documents are **GRIDCO, Haryana Discoms (HPPC), and Bihar Discoms**.\n*   This directly refutes the argument made by the Haryana Discoms that the coal supplied under the firm linkage should be appropriated solely for the capacity being supplied to them. The CERC and APTEL found this contention to be incorrect.\n\n### **2. Pro-Rata Apportionment for Shortfall Costs**\n\n*   In addition to the supplied coal, the cost of procuring coal from **alternate sources** (such as imported or open market coal) to meet any shortfall in the firm and tapering linkage supply must also be apportioned on a pro-rata basis.\n*   This apportionment of cost is based on the amount of power supplied to each of the beneficiaries.\n\n### **3. Rationale for the Decision**\n\nThe decision that coal supply was for the \"project as a whole\" is supported by several key pieces of evidence cited in the documents:\n\n*   **Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA):** Clause 4.2 of the FSA dated March 26, 2013, with Mahanadi Coalfield Limited (MCL) clearly states that \"the total quantity of coal supplied pursuant to this Agreement is meant for use at Power Plant (3x350 MW)...\"\n*   **Standing Linkage Committee (SLC) Minutes:** The SLC minutes from February 14, 2012, noted that the tapering linkage of 2.384 MTPA was to be utilized for all three Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with GRIDCO, Haryana, and Bihar Discoms.\n*   **Confirmation from Coal Supplier:** A letter from MCL dated May 2, 2018, confirmed that coal is released for the total PPA capacity of the station and is not bifurcated based on individual PPAs.\n*   **Original Allocations:** The Letters of Assurance (LOAs) for coal and the allocation letter for the captive coal mine were all made for the entire plant's capacity (1050 MW), not for specific parts of it tied to different procurers.\n\nIn summary, the judgment firmly establishes that all coal (firm, tapering, and alternate) and its associated costs must be shared proportionally among all beneficiaries, as the coal supply was always intended for the entire power station, not for individual power purchase agreements.",

    "question": "In Kiran vs Rajkumar Jivraj Jain (2025), what bar does Section 18 of the SC/ST Act impose on anticipatory bail, and under what condition may a court consider granting it despite this bar?",
    "ground_truth": "Section 18 of the SC/ST Act generally bars the grant of anticipatory bail in cases involving offenses under the Act; however, if on a prima facie reading the allegations do not make out any offense under the Act, the court may exercise discretion to grant anticipatory bail.",
    "answer": "Based on the judgment in Kiran vs Rajkumar Jivraj Jain (2025), Section 18 of the SC/ST Act imposes a near-absolute bar on granting anticipatory bail. A court may only consider granting it if the allegations in the First Information Report (FIR), on the face of it, do not disclose a prima facie case for an offence under the Act.",

    "question": "What fundamental procedural principle did the Supreme Court emphasize as violated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in M/S Triveni Engineering And Industries Ltd vs State Of Uttar Pradesh (2025), leading to the setting aside of environment compensation orders?",
    "ground_truth": "The Supreme Court found that NGT violated principles of natural justice by not impleading the affected party, denying a fair opportunity of hearing, and not following statutory sampling and analysis procedures under the Water Act, making its orders illegal and void.",
    "answer": "Of course! Based on the documents provided, I can give you a detailed explanation.\n\nThe fundamental procedural principle that the Supreme Court emphasized as being violated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) was the **principles of natural justice**.\n\nThe judgment in M/S Triveni Engineering And Industries Ltd vs State Of Uttar Pradesh makes it \"crystal clear\" that the NGT's decisions, which imposed adverse civil consequences on the appellant, were passed without following both the due procedure laid down by statute and the \"elementary principles of natural justice.\"\n\nHere are the specific details from the documents:\n\n*   **Core Violation:** The Supreme Court explicitly states, \"it is crystal clear that the impugned decisions which entail adverse civil consequences upon the appellant were passed without following the due procedure laid down under the statute as well as the elementary principles of natural justice. We, therefore, have no hesitation in declaring such orders to be illegal and null and void.\" (page_label: 26)\n\n*   **Natural Justice is Inalienable:** The Court stressed that since the NGT exercises judicial functions, it is \"all the more necessary for the NGT to adhere to a fair procedure which is statutorily laid down of which principles of natural justice are an inalienable part.\" (page_label: 26)\n\n*   **What Natural Justice Entails:** The judgment references another case, *State Bank of India Vs. Rajesh Agarwal*, to define natural justice, highlighting two fundamental principles:\n    1.  **nemo judex in causa sua:** No person should be a Judge in their own cause.\n    2.  **audi alteram partem:** A person affected by an action must be heard before a decision is taken.\n    The court noted that these are not \"mere legal formalities\" but \"substantive obligations.\" (page_label: 23)\n\n*   **Improper Procedure:** The Court found that the NGT had violated these principles by \"outsourcing investigation to administrative committees\" and then \"basing its decisions on the recommendation of such administrative committee.\" This was seen as a way of bypassing the statutory procedures laid down in Sections 21 and 22 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. (page_label: 26)\n\nIn essence, the Supreme Court found that the NGT, in its \"quest for doing justice,\" ended up doing the reverse by not giving the appellant a fair hearing and by relying on an external committee's report without following the legally mandated procedures. This violation of natural justice was so fundamental that the entire exercise was deemed \"vitiated,\" leading the Supreme Court to set aside the NGT's orders dated 15.02.2022 and 16.09.2022.

    "question": "In Phireram vs State Of Uttar Pradesh (2025), how did the Supreme Court clarify the relationship between witness protection under the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 and the cancellation of bail?",
    "ground_truth": "The Supreme Court clarified that the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 is not an alternative or substitute for cancellation of bail when an accused threatens witnesses; courts must address bail cancellation independently under established legal principles if bail conditions are violated.",
    "answer": "Of course! Based on the documents provided, I can give you a very detailed explanation of how the Supreme Court clarified this relationship in the case of *Phireram vs State Of Uttar Pradesh (2025)*.\n\nThe Supreme Court made it very clear that the **Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 is not an alternative to or a substitute for the cancellation of bail**. They are two distinct legal mechanisms with different purposes, and one cannot be used as a reason to neglect the other.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the Court's clarification based on the provided text:\n\n### 1. They Serve Different Purposes\n\nThe Court drew a \"fine but pertinent distinction\" between the two:\n\n*   **Witness Protection Scheme (WPS):** This is described as a **\"remedial and curative measure.\"** Its main goal is to address the psychological impact of threats on a witness and to \"neutralise the effects of threats once they have materialised.\" The Court emphasizes that its purpose is to \"eradicate the corrosive effect that intimidation and threats... have upon the witness’s ability to speak the truth fearlessly.\" This is seen as a \"positive obligation of the State.\" (page_label: 7, paragraphs 36, 38)\n*   **Cancellation of Bail:** This is described as a **\"preventive and supervisory function\"** of the court. Its purpose is to ensure that the trial proceeds \"unpolluted by intimidation.\" The court has a duty to supervise the accused's conduct after release and to revoke bail if the conditions are breached. This is a \"judicial\" function, not a state obligation. (page_label: 7, paragraphs 38, 41)\n\n### 2. The Scheme Was Created Because Bail Cancellation Wasn't Enough\n\nThe Court went into the history of the Witness Protection Scheme to emphasize that it was created precisely because the existing provisions for bail cancellation were \"wholly insufficient\" to reassure witnesses facing threats. Various committees, like the National Police Commission and the Malimath Committee, had noted that witnesses were turning hostile despite the possibility of bail cancellation because the system did not provide a \"protective shield.\" (page_label: 6, paragraph 33)\n\nTherefore, the scheme was designed to *complement* the law on bail, not replace it.\n\n### 3. Using the Scheme to Avoid Bail Cancellation is a \"Mockery of Justice\"\n\nThis is the most critical point the Court made. It stated unequivocally:\n\n> \"The existence of a Witness Protection Scheme can by no stretch be a consideration to decline to cancel the bail, even when there is prima- facie material indicating that the accused administered threats or caused intimidation to the witnesses.\" (page_label: 7, paragraph 39)\n\nThe Court argued that to substitute one for the other would:\n*   \"Denude the court of its authority.\"\n*   \"Render the provisions of bail cancellation otiose\" (serving no practical purpose).\n*   Make a \"mockery of the conditions imposed while granting bail.\" (page_label: 7, paragraph 39)\n\nIn essence, the Court said that bail conditions, such as not tampering with evidence or threatening witnesses, are \"substantive obligations.\" If an accused violates these conditions, it is the duty of the court that granted bail to cancel it. Simply telling the threatened witness to seek protection under the scheme while allowing the accused to remain free on bail is an abdication of the court's responsibility.",

    "question": "According to Ramesh Chand (D) Thr.Lrs vs Suresh Chand (2025), does an agreement to sell, power of attorney, or receipt of consideration confer ownership title to immovable property under Indian law?",
    "ground_truth": "No, an agreement to sell, power of attorney, or receipt of consideration does not confer ownership title to immovable property; title is transferred only through a validly executed and registered sale deed as per Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act.",
    "answer": "According to the judgment in Ramesh Chand (D) Thr. Lrs vs Suresh Chand (2025), an agreement to sell, power of attorney, or receipt of consideration does not confer ownership title to immovable property. The judgment holds that title in such property can only be conveyed through a duly stamped and registered sale deed.",
